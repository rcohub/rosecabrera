## Reflection
As the final project in the VR Developer Nanodegree program, everything we learned up until this point was put to the test: creating animation triggers, keeping a scoreboard and controlling objects with C# scripts, displaying the score via a simple UI, creating custom skyboxes, adding indoor/outdoor lighting and reflections, modifying Google SDK player controllers, managing GameObjects physics, and much more.
